# Cashatak Project

This document provides an overview of the Cashatak project, its structure, and how to build and run it.

## Project Structure

The project follows a Model-View-Controller (MVC) inspired architecture to promote separation of concerns and maintainability.

### Directory Explanations:

*   **`CMakeLists.txt` (root):** The main entry point for building the project with CMake.
*   **`README.md`:** This file. Contains project information, setup instructions, and an explanation of the directory structure.
*   **`assets/`:** (Optional) Stores static assets that are not compiled directly into the binary via QRC, or are too large for it. For example, large images, fonts, or themes that might be loaded at runtime from the filesystem.
*   **`build/`:** This directory is created when you run CMake and build the project. It contains all intermediate build files, libraries, and the final executable. **It should be added to `.gitignore`.**
*   **`src/`:** Contains all the source code for the application.
    *   **`main.cpp`:** The entry point of the application, responsible for initializing Qt and showing the main window.
    *   **`app/`:** (Optional) Contains application-wide logic, services (like networking, settings management), and general utility classes that are not directly part of the UI or core business model but support the application's functioning.
    *   **`core/`:** This is the **Model** part of MVC. It contains the business logic, data structures, and classes that represent the application's domain (e.g., `Account`, `Transaction`, `User`). These classes should be independent of the UI. Your current files like `Account.h/.cpp`, `User.h/.cpp`, etc., belong here.
    *   **`ui/`:** This directory houses the **View** and often parts of the **Controller** logic (especially in Qt's model/view architecture or when using patterns like MVP/MVVM alongside).
        *   **`windows/`:** Contains the main application windows and top-level dialogs (e.g., your `Cashatak.h/.cpp/.ui` would conceptually be a main window here). These are typically `QMainWindow` or `QDialog` subclasses.
        *   **`widgets/`:** Reusable custom UI components that can be used across different windows or parts of the application.
        *   **`models/`:** Qt item models (subclasses of `QAbstractItemModel`, `QAbstractListModel`, `QAbstractTableModel`, etc.) that provide data to Qt's views (like `QListView`, `QTableView`, `QTreeView`). These adapt your core business objects for display.
        *   **`delegates/`:** Custom item delegates (subclasses of `QAbstractItemDelegate` or `QStyledItemDelegate`) for controlling how data is rendered and edited in item views.
    *   **`stdafx.h`/`stdafx.cpp`:** Precompiled header files.
*   **`resources/`:** Contains files that are compiled into the application binary using Qt's Resource System (`.qrc` files). This typically includes `.ui` files (like your `Cashatak.ui`), small icons, translation files, etc.
*   **`tests/`:** (Optional) Contains all unit tests and integration tests for the project. It might have its own subdirectory structure reflecting the `src/` layout.

This structure helps separate:
*   **Model (`src/core/`):** The data and business logic.
*   **View (`src/ui/windows/`, `src/ui/widgets/`, `.ui` files):** What the user sees.
*   **Controller/Presenter (`src/ui/` subdirectories, leveraging Qt's signals/slots and model/view):** Mediates between Model and View, handles user input, and updates the view based on model changes.

## Building the Project (Linux Example)

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   CMake (version 3.16 or higher)
    *   A C++17 compliant compiler (e.g., GCC)
    *   Qt6 SDK (ensure the path to Qt6 is known to CMake, e.g., by setting `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`)

2.  **Configure with CMake:**
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/Cashatak  # Navigate to the project root
    mkdir build && cd build
    # Example: cmake .. -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=~/Qt/6.X.Y/gcc_64
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/your/Qt6 # Replace with your actual Qt path
    ```

3.  **Compile:**
    ```bash
    make  # Or ninja, if you configured CMake to use Ninja
    ```

4.  **Run:**
    The executable will be located in the `build/bin/` directory.
    ```bash
    ./bin/Cashatak
    ```

## Building the Project (Windows with Visual Studio)

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   CMake (GUI or command line)
    *   Visual Studio (with C++ development workload)
    *   Qt6 SDK (MSVC version corresponding to your Visual Studio version)

2.  **Configure with CMake:**
    *   Open CMake GUI.
    *   Set the "source code" directory to your project root.
    *   Set the "build binaries" directory to a `build` subdirectory.
    *   Click "Configure". Select the appropriate Visual Studio generator.
    *   If Qt6 is not found automatically, add an entry for `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` pointing to your Qt6 MSVC installation (e.g., `C:/Qt/6.X.Y/msvcXXXX_64`).
    *   Click "Generate".

3.  **Compile:**
    *   Open the generated `.sln` file in the `build` directory with Visual Studio.
    *   Build the solution from Visual Studio.

4.  **Run:**
    *   Run the `Cashatak` target from Visual Studio.

## Next Steps

*   Refactor your existing code into the proposed MVC structure.
*   Update the `CMakeLists.txt` to reflect the new file locations once you move them.
*   Create a `.gitignore` file.
